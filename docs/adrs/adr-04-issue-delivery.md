# ADR-04 — issue delivery (triage-and-fix)

## CONTEXT

> This harness owns both the law and the delivery cast. One SSOT tree.
> Runtimes differ; the phases, contracts, and assertion duties do not.

Rules only. Phase names, dispatch maps, and operator wiring live in the
documents listed under RELATED — not in this ADR. Formerly numbered
`adr-02`; renumbered to `adr-04` on 2026-08-02 so constitution and harness
tooling own `01`/`02`.

## ASSERTIONS

1. GitHub issue delivery ships **in this repository**: skill
   `docs/skills/triage-and-fix/`, cast `docs/agents/kwf-*.md`, deps CLI
   `docs/skills/triage-and-fix/bin/kwf-deps`. That tree is the SSOT — not a
   sibling checkout.
2. **Include, adapt by runtime.** The playbook and YAML contracts are
   runtime-agnostic. Model pins and spawn mechanics live in
   `docs/skills/triage-and-fix/references/runtimes.md` (Kimi, Claude Code,
   Cursor/Grok). A runtime may lack a native `kwf-*` registry; it still runs
   the same phases by injecting the agent files as prompts.
3. Doctrine-first planning is binding: PRD and ADRs in force before a plan;
   inquisitor before camp. That duty does not replace [[adr-03-guardians]] —
   guardians still gate law changes after publish.
4. After plaza / bard publishes, the **owner process** closes the batch: run
   `docs/hooks/guardian-dispatch --bundle` against the delivered change set;
   paste the payload and dispatch
   every guardian owed; honor `violation` / `danger` / `needs-new-adr` per
   [[adr-03-guardians]].
5. When a plan slice or delivered diff touches `docs/assertions/` or claims
   to satisfy an assertion law, builders follow [[TDD]] and the
   `assertion-review` skill: proving tests first, linked under `### Tests`,
   then the code. The inquisitor treats "touches assertions without a TDD
   step" as a plan `violation`. The owner process runs `assertion-review`
   on those assertions before the batch closes.
6. Unmet assertion laws do not block unrelated issues. They block (or
   redirect into TDD) only work that claims those laws or edits their
   files — hunter `constitutionOk` / camp deviations record the block;
   inventing a new assertion without the owner is forbidden
   ([[assertion-00-discipline]]).
7. **Assertions are the entry path for important new features.** Delivery
   may land ordinary fixes without an assertion; any feature the owner
   elevates to a lasting promise enters as an assertion law, then tests,
   then code — never code-first against a silent wish.

## FORBIDDEN

- **NEVER** keep a second SSOT for the cast outside this tree (rule 1). A
  historical sibling may mirror or point here; it must not diverge as a
  competing source of truth.
- **NEVER** treat a bard PR as batch-closed when `guardian-dispatch` named
  a guardian that was not run (rule 4).
- **NEVER** mark an assertion `verified` from a party run without proving
  tests per [[TDD]] (rule 5).

## REJECTED

- **Compose-only sibling (no cast in-tree)** — keep `kwf-*` exclusively in
  `~/Dev/harness-triage-party` and discover it globally. Rejected 2026-08-02:
  the main harness must ship a working delivery path for clones; multi-runtime
  adaptation requires the cast beside the law and assertions. Reopen only if
  delivery is deliberately dropped from the template.
- **Vendoring as Kimi-only blobs with no runtime map** — copy agents without
  documenting Claude/Cursor-Grok dispatch. Rejected because the playbook's
  value is the phase contracts, not one CLI's `Agent` tool.
- **Name-only post-bard guardian close** — run `guardian-dispatch` without
  `--bundle` and let each guardian rediscover the batch. Rejected 2026-08-03
  in favor of [[adr-03-guardians]] rule 9. Reopen only with that ADR.
