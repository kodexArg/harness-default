# ADR-01 — constitution (source markdown)

## CONTEXT

> This is the first and main ADR of the project law. It binds the source
> markdown: PRD, constitution, living docs, ADR and assertion families —
> what counts as written truth and in what order.

Rules only. How the pieces fit in prose lives in [[HARNESS]]; document
shape lives in [[CONVENTION]] and the family `-00` disciplines.

## ASSERTIONS

1. **Authority order.** [[PRD]] is the objective at the top. Beneath it
   sits the rest of `docs/constitution/` — how the project is run. Beneath
   that sit the ADRs in `docs/adrs/` — the binding decisions. Beneath those
   sit every other document under `docs/`. Where layers disagree, the higher
   layer wins; where an ADR and the code disagree, the ADR wins
   ([[adr-00-discipline]] rule 11).
2. **[[PRD]] is mandatory and short.** It states what the product is, who
   it serves, and the horizon. Behavior, stories, requirements, and
   assertion laws are not inlined there — they live with their owners and
   are reached by wikilink from the PRD's "What it must do" section.
3. **Constitution tier.** A file earns `docs/constitution/` only when it is
   both meaningful and stable. Changing the constitution is an event.
   Meaningful-but-volatile or stable-but-unimportant material lives
   directly under `docs/`.
4. **ADRs are load-bearing.** Presence in `docs/adrs/` is what makes a
   decision binding ([[adr-00-discipline]] rule 6). Complying with every ADR
   in force is a precondition for adding anything to the project (rule 9).
   This ADR (`adr-01`) is the entry point for the project's written law;
   later harness ADRs specialize themes beneath it.
5. **Families accumulate; tiers sort.** `docs/adrs/` and `docs/assertions/`
   are numbered families ruled by their `-00` discipline files. They do not
   sort by stability — they append. Sorting by "meaningful and stable"
   applies only to constitution vs loose `docs/` documents.
6. **Assertions are laws.** Owner-reserved, kept few, optional as a set.
   Every assertion that exists must be met via proving tests ([[TDD]],
   `assertion-review`). They are the entry path for important features.
   When an assertion and the constitution disagree, the assertion is wrong
   ([[assertion-00-discipline]]).
7. **Knowledge under `docs/`.** Everything the project *knows* lives under
   `docs/`. Code roots and `state/` hold what the project *is*. Facts that
   an ADR rule stands on live in `docs/` documents and are reached by
   wikilink — never inlined into the ADR ([[adr-00-discipline]] rule 1).

## FORBIDDEN

- **NEVER** put product behavior, use cases, or assertion laws into the PRD
  body (rule 2). That duplicates owners and drifts.
- **NEVER** treat a document outside `docs/adrs/` as an ADR, or an ADR
  outside that directory as binding (rule 4).
- **NEVER** invent a product assertion without the owner (rule 6).
