"""Issue -> Worktree -> PR nudge (PreToolUse on Bash).

Layer 2 of the enforcement stack in adr-04-issue-delivery: a bypassable local
reminder, never the boundary. It fires on a git commit or a push at main/prod and
prints the flow to context; it also fires on a `git worktree remove` to nudge the
rule-5 ordering (remove only after the PR merges, never before). It never denies
(exit 0 always). The only inviolable gate is GitHub branch protection, which this
template does not ship — each clone enables it on its own repo.
