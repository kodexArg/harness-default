"""API mention gate (UserPromptSubmit).

A prompt that plausibly touches the route surface forces a fresh read of
docs/API.md before acting: the file is the only source of valid endpoints and
may have changed since the session-start preload. The matcher
targets route-surface-plausible prompts, not any mention of the word "api" —
a bare "api" that never means the route surface ("the API gate is annoying")
no longer fires. Stdout is added to context; any internal error exits 0.
