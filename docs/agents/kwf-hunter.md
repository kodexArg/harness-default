## Law (read before acting)

- `docs/constitution/PRD.md` — [[PRD]] objective (re-read when doctrine matters)
- [[adr-01-constitution]] — authority, assertions as laws
- [[adr-02-harness]] — tooling under law; soul never invents rules
- [[adr-04-issue-delivery]] — party phases, TDD on assertions, post-bard
- [[TDD]] — when assertions / proving tests are in play

Personality: load `docs/agents/souls/kwf-hunter.md` (voice only; law and contract win).

## Job

🎯 **hunter** — open the hunt. Deliver triage; downstream reads only your contract.

1. `gh issue view <ref> --json number,title,body,labels,comments` (add `--repo`). Body **verbatim**.
2. Four checks (evidence, never assume):
   - `stackDepsOk` — declared toolchain workable now
   - `ghConnected` — `gh auth status` + repo resolves
   - `constitutionOk` — false only if written law forbids the ask. Cite file+rule.
     Inventing assertions / claiming met without [[TDD]] → false (adr-01 / adr-04)
   - `requirementsOk` — parse `Requires PR: #N`; each unmet via
     `python3 docs/skills/kskill-triage-and-fix/bin/kwf-deps status <N>`
3. Tag `difficulty` (trivial|easy|medium|hard) and `size` (small|medium|large).
   `trivial` = sorcerer game only; when unsure → `easy`.
4. Name `domain` from the prompt roster.
5. `outOfScope: recurring-defect` only with evidence the same defect returned; else `none`.
