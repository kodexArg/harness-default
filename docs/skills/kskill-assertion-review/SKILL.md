  Enforce assertion laws: interpret each promise, require proving tests via
  TDD.md, drive the fix or feature until tests hold, set verified. Use when
  reviewing docs/assertions/, adding an assertion, periodic re-check, or when
  the owner asks to satisfy or audit an assertion.

# Assertion review

You enforce the project's **assertion laws**. Assertions are few,
owner-reserved, and expensive on purpose. Each one is an entry path for a
solution: tests first (per [[TDD]] / `docs/TDD.md`), then the code that
makes those tests pass — and the tests remain forever.

Discipline and template: `docs/assertions/assertion-00-discipline.md`.
Do not invent a parallel process.

## When you run

- The owner (or owner process) asks to review, satisfy, or audit assertions.
- A new `assertion-NN-*.md` appeared or an existing law changed.
- Periodic re-verification of every assertion in force (all files matching
  `docs/assertions/assertion-*.md` except `assertion-00-discipline.md`).

## Procedure

### 1. Inventory

Glob `docs/assertions/assertion-*.md`. Skip `assertion-00-discipline.md`.
If the dispatch names one assertion, work that file only; otherwise review
each in force. Reach docs through the vault when available; Read/Grep are
the fallback.

### 2. Interpret the law (LLM judgment — required)

Read the assertion paragraph in full. Write down, for yourself and then in
the report, **every concrete rule** the paragraph imposes (bounds, counts,
paths, equality, latency, …). Do not reduce the law to its title. If the
paragraph is too vague to derive runnable checks, **fail the review**: the
owner must tighten the law; you do not invent product scope.

### 3. Resolve RELATED

Every link under `## RELATED` must resolve to a real path or vault target.
Broken links → fail. The `### Tests` chapter is the proving surface: at
least one runnable test must **demonstrate** the interpreted rules.

Examples of what counts:

- Law: backend latency ≤ 500ms → a test that fails above 500ms.
- Law: stored X equals displayed X → a test that writes, reads the display
  path, asserts equality.

Prose, checklists, and production comments are not proving tests.

### 4. If unmet — TDD, then code

If `### Tests` is missing, empty, non-runnable, or does not encode the
interpreted rules:

1. Open `docs/TDD.md` and follow it. No feature work before failing tests
   exist and are linked under `### Tests`.
2. Author the failing tests that encode every rule from step 2.
3. Link them in the assertion file under `### Tests`.
4. Implement the fix or feature until those tests pass.
5. Link any new realizing source under `### Files` as needed.

If tests already encode the law but are red, implement until green — still
under TDD.md, without weakening the tests to match broken code.

### 5. Verify and stamp

Re-run the proving tests. On full success for this assertion, set
frontmatter `verified: YYYY-MM-DD` (today) and `updated` to the same day
when the body or links changed. If anything remains unmet, do **not**
advance `verified`; leave `never` or the last good date.

## Output

Return exactly this shape (one block per assertion reviewed):

```
assertion: assertion-NN-slug
status: verified | unmet | ill-formed
rules: <comma-separated concrete rules you interpreted>
tests: <paths that prove the law, or "none">
resolution: <one line — what you verified, wrote, or still need from the owner>
```

- `verified` — links resolve, tests demonstrate every rule, tests pass,
  `verified` date stamped.
- `unmet` — law is clear but evidence or implementation is incomplete;
  say whether tests were added and what code remains.
- `ill-formed` — paragraph cannot be turned into runnable checks; owner
  must rewrite the law.

## Forbidden

- Marking `verified` when `### Tests` does not prove the interpreted rules.
- Implementing product code for an unmet assertion before failing tests
  exist and are linked (skips `docs/TDD.md`).
- Adding assertions yourself unless the owner explicitly reserved one —
  this family is owner-gated.
- Weakening or deleting proving tests to obtain a green run.
